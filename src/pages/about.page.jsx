              I have been studying web development extensively  and I develop in both C# and PHP, though I primarily use C#. I am experienced in both front and back-end development, and I am proficient in HTML, CSS, SASS, React, JavaScript, NodeJS, Django, jQuery, AJAX, and SQL/MySQL/PostgreSQL. I am also proficient in many non-web-based languages, including but not limited to Java, C, C++, Python. I have worked on group as well as personal projects, and have used the different languages to create useful tools for data processing, visualizing data, as well as general purpose apps.
